Getting Started with GtkAda
===========================

These are the source code for [Getting Started with GtkAda](http://zhu-qy.blogspot.ca/2014/03/getting-started-with-gtkada.html).

It follows the examples in [Getting Sttarted with Gtk+](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.8/gtk-getting-started.html).

Where the exampleapp is following the [latest Gtk+
version](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s05.html),
but since GtkAda is only at Gtk+ 3.8, most of the code could not be
done at GtkAda, as it uses lots of new wigets in 3.10+. So only the first
step of empty window was done. This will be updated once GtkAda support
 the new widgets.
